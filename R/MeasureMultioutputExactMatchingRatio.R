# FIXME: Implement this
# Take ExactMatchingRatio from
# https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/233275/multilabel-classification-metrics-on-scikit
# This needs to check for task_property multilabel
# This should work for all metrics based on the confusion matrix.
# Is this the micro or the macro approach, find out the correct naming.
# Also check if we can just find a different way to compute the confusion matrix for this and
# ok. Stefan might have a paper here!
